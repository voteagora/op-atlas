          Retro Funding 4 will reward onchain builders who have deployed
          contracts to the Superchain and contributed to the success of
          Optimism. This round seeks to expand the reach and impact of the
          network by rewarding those building across the Superchain who have
          increased demand for blockspace and driven value to the Collective.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an effort to make voting in this round as objective as possible,
          your project&apos;s code and contracts will be analyzed using
          quality-metrics. Citizen badgeholders will vote on the quality-metrics
          that matter most to them, not on individual projects.{" "}
