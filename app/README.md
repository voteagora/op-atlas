## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community and are pleased to have you join us in improving this project. To contribute to this project, please follow the steps outlined below:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub workflows

## Contribution Workflow

To make a contribution, please follow the git-flow workflow:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button on the upper right-hand side of the repository's page.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**

   - Clone the repository to your local machine by running:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
     ```

   - Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of the repository you're contributing to.

3. **Create a New Branch**

   - Before making any changes, switch to a new branch using the git-flow naming convention: `<your-name>/<feature-or-fix-description>`

     ```bash
     git checkout -b <your-name>/<feature-or-fix-description>
     ```

   - Example: `git checkout -b john-doe/add-login-feature`

4. **Make Your Changes**

   - Implement your feature or fix.
   - Add and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
     ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**

   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

     ```bash
     git push origin <your-name>/<feature-or-fix-description>
     ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
   - Click the "Pull request" button next to your branch.
   - Review the changes and fill out the pull request form with a clear title and description of what your changes entail and why they are needed.
   - Click "Create pull request."

## Review Process

After you submit your pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. If any further modifications are required, we will provide feedback. Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch.

## Stay Up-to-Date

To ensure your fork stays current with the main repository, set up the original repository as an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner-username/original-repository.git
```
